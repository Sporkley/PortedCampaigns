The world of Onobu has existed in relative peace and prosperity for the past 2,000 years, ever since the destruction of Chaos.
In recent years a man named Lukahn has given fame to a prophecy that four Light Warriors will come to save the world in a time
of darkness.  Many believed this to be an old prophecy that had already come to pass, when Chaos was defeated two millinea ago,
until the orbs of light were recently re-discovered.

Your characters have each stumbled upon one of the four orbs of light - powerful artifacts of unknown potential linked to each
of the elemental powers. 

* The air orb shines with a whispy, white light
* The earth orb resembles a perfectly spherical stone and emits a green light.
* The water orb glows blue and seems to swirl and flow with a liquid within.
* The fire orb rages chaoticly with a bright yellow and red flickering light.

Players should determine how and which orb they have discovered.  It is likely that the air orb was found high on a mountaintop,
and the water orb submerged in a lake, etc.  Regardless, they have all seemingly emerged back into the world at the same time, 
and their bearers know that they are the warriors of light.
