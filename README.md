The purpose of this repository is to introduce new generations to stories told before, usually from classic video game RPGS.
The focus of the repository is on the story and various adventures within and will not be specific to any particular game
system.  Thus to be fully compatible with your RPG system of choice these campaign modules will need to be fleshed out with
enemies, loot, and magic systems where necessary.

In general these campaigns are not sandbox friendly - they have a specific story to be told and players will largely be
"on rails."  Thus these will probably be more approprite for inexperienced tabletop RPG players.
